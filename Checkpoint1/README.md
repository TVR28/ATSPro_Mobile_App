Summary of Project

Project Analysis
Value Proposition

your claim that these are real pain points/problems to address)
Primary Purpose
(Summarize the purpose of the project – could be something focused on the benefit of the target
audience, your customers, your “company,” or even public good)
Target Audience
(State your target demographic, be as specific as you can. Why are you targeting this demographic?
How do you plan you reach it?)
Success Criteria
(How will you know whether your app was successful? Financial gain? User satisfaction? Market share?
Public good? How will you measure the success?)
Competitor Analysis
(Summarize strengths/weaknesses of your competitors as compared to you – does not have to be in-
depth, focus on things that relate directly to your purpose and value prop)
Monetization Model
(Briefly propose a monetization model)
Initial Design
The purpose of this section is to define the “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP). It may also be useful to
call out the scope and expected/known limitations for your product here.
UI/UX Design
(Call out important UI/UX components to have an MVP – does not have to be polished, but should keep
the audience, purpose, and value prop in mind)
Technical Architecture
(What are the necessary components to support an MVP? Data structures? Storage considerations?
Web/cloud interactions? Be sure to put in some thoughts as to how to measure your success here. Call
out dependencies on 3rd party services/APIs here, too)
Challenges and Open Questions
Identify technical challenges that may come up (e.g. hardware limitations, access to data/services,
performance issues, etc.) and propose some solutions to the identified challenges. Also include questions
on matters that you are unsure/unclear about that requires feedback from peers, users, or additional
research.
