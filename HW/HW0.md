# HW0 - Getting Started

I'm planning to build an **ATSPro** App on IOS to provide a one stop solution to conquer Application Tracking Software during job applications and achieve their dream job.

## Intended Platform 
I'm interested to work and build my application on iOS Platform as its a new learning experience to me and I want to gain expertise in iOS app development.

## Intended Programming Language
Since I'm choosing iOS as my platform, I'm inclined towards using **Swift** to build my mobile application to provide better User exp and UI for iOS. That being said I never developed an app using Swift before so I hope this would be a great learning experience for me.

## Whether you want to explore cross-platform development?
I want to explore cross-platform development as well, and in that case I might use **React-Native** to develop my application (Thinking to explore using Swift for cross-platform development)

## Brief Explaination of Sections
While my initial focus is on iOS development with Swift, I'm also considering the broader potential of my ATSPro App by exploring cross-platform development options. My interest in possibly using React Native for this purpose indicates a strategic approach to development, where I'm looking to balance the depth of native platform capabilities with the breadth of reach that cross-platform solutions can provide. I'm thinking about the future scalability of my app and the possibility of extending its availability to a wider audience without needing to completely rebuild it for each platform. I would like to explore Swift for cross-platform development to demonstrate flexible, innovative approach to solving the challenges of multi-platform app creation, although Swift is typically more native to iOS.
